User Stories

- Users should be able to add a new incident
- Users should be able to view incident histories
- Users should be able to view visual charts of incidents

TODO:

- Login page so that incidents are signed off by a specific ski patroller (first on scene)
- Edit / Delete incidents? --> No, because incidents should not be able to be modified after submission (legal stuff? have to keep incident reports for x years?)
- Add more charts
- Add an interactive visual map that has highlights / heatmap of incidents - kind of like Google Maps traffic heatmap?
- Add dropdown so can change to any of the Canadian Ski Patrol mountains (Cypress, Seymour, Manning, Sasquatch)
- Each mountain has their own incident reports
